        # Data connections. In that connection, the reader will see only the

        # Buffered connections. In that case, the reader will be able to read
        # all the samples received since the last read. A buffer in between the
        # output and input port will keep the samples that have not been read
        # already.  Such a connection is set up with:

        #   output_port.connect_to input_port, :type => :buffer, :size => 10
